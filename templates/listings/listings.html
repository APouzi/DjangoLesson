{% comment %} Listings URLS & Templates - 12:48 change this to a dynamic temple tag. 13:18 Now, when we when we create the database, we create our listings model. We create all of our tables and stuff. What we'll do is reach into the database, pass the listings into the template from the views.py. And then we'll loop through the listings and output one of these divs. We're not going to need all of this markup.We're only going to need to loop through the listings and output one of these and have dynamic price, address, etc. (14:11 go to _navbar to change the featered listings href){% endcomment %}

{% comment %}Pull Data From Listings Model - 6:13 he shows how we want to go to "section id = "listings" and how we want to loop only one "listing" not all six of these. 6:51 go right above where it says listing 1 and input the temple tags with the conditionals using jinja, call the if tag "lisitings". This way we check to see if there are listings, also put an else statement. The else statement is going to have a div with a class of col-md-12. When the if statement does the check for listings and if it gets back listings, we want to do a for loop inside there looping through the listings 7:57. Now, 8:16 we want to grab our listing html and put it inside the for loop. After that we can get rid of the other listings. 9:10 Now that we have done that, we have six listings of the same markup since we haven't don't anything yet. END OF VIDEO{% endcomment %}

There is plenty of options but brad is going to use an app called "humanize" which will take care of that.(3:04 go to btre/settings.py and go to "installed_apps") 3:42 now we have to load the import in "load humanize" at the top of the file. Now we have a list of functions we can pipe onto values. For this to work we want to use the pipe "|" character and then "intcomma".

{% comment %}Pagination, Order & Filter -7:31 add an li with a class of page-item, they should all have this class the li's. As far as the href goes we want to input "?page=" with the previous page number inside of jinja syntax and then we can use "&laquo;" to give us arrows {% endcomment %}

After we input the endif, what we want to do is loop through our "page range" or how many pages we have, in order to go to the page we want to go to. This is how we do the for loop: "for i in listings.paginator.page_range" and page_range being how many pages we have. Below that we will be asking if the pages we are listing, if one of them is active, as in we are looking at them, then we should have it highlighted to know which page we are on, the else statement is just going to output the numbers and not be highlighted BUT they will have a link on them so we can click to those pages and the href is going to have an href of a query of whatever the number is.  {% endcomment %}

{% comment %}Pagination, Order & Filter - 13:51 lastly we are going to be adding a forward arrow if there is a next page and we want to be outside of the endfor. For that we are going to be copying the "previous_page_number" one and pasting that into here. Change all "previous" words into "next" words and then change "&laquo;" to "&raquo;" to have arrows face the other way. This has exact same functionality execpt the other way .
